My name is Sam. I'm the factory floor manager at SpillTech Industries. Unfortunately, WOSHA is inspecting my factory this week...
I'm really stressed out!!
My factory is a certainly-not-up-to-code mess! None of my employees will do anything about it because HR says "it is one of my responsibilites as manager to ensure the floor is a safe and responsible working environment."
I think the employees are fine! We've only had two incidents this week...

June: Can I get a pack of Dramadaries?
Clerk: Sure. That'll be 4.56
In exchange for a fiver she recieves change and the aforementioned cigarettes. Funnily enough, I smoke Dramadaries too.
I buy my cigarettes. The girl in the hard hat glanced at me when I stated my preference of brand.

June: That's funny!â€” I don't know many people who smoke Dramadaries!
